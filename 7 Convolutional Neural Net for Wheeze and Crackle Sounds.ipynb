The pooling layer is do reduce the dimensionality of the model (by reducing the parameters and subsquent computation requirements) which serves to shorten the training time and reduce overfitting. The Max Pooling type takes the maximum size for each window and the Global Average Pooling type takes the average which is suitable for feeding into our `dense` output layer.  \n",
